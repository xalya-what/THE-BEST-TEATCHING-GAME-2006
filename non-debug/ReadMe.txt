hope you don't anger pizzabox... because if you do... it will delete your game.
do not harass pizzabox he is just your computer.
there are a lot of hidden secrets i hope you can find them.
and remember that ilikeeatingpizza.
also if you by chance stumble upon "your player" and you want your pc to not be infected
then i advice you to close the game and start another one.
same goes when you anger pizzabox so much by trying to escape from hard mode.
insane mode will start.
and will wipe anything you ever hard on your personal computer.
also..
